# h5 Laboratory and simulationenvironment attacks
## a) Evilginx2

- Because the instructions were very minimal I didn't really get an idea on how to approach the subject
- So in the end I decided to watch a video of someone using the tool

How hackers Bypass Multi Factor Authentication | Evilginx 2 - Cyberlinx Security (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn5MR9jl_tk)
- In the video the man boots up Evilginx2 and he explains that the attack begins by sending false links to the victim so the victim would use the fake site

- Here is the final result after the victim has entered their credentials
- The victim is using two factor authentication

- But evilginx2 has been able to hijack the session id which includes the token

- Then the threat actor uses the victims cookie to login to the actual site

## b) Mininet

- The instructions were minimal again and I couldn't get mininet to work
- I will try again later
