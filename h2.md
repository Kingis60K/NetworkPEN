## x) Read and Summarize

Pyramid of Pain (https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)
- The higher a technique is on the pyramid, the harder it is for the attack to continue once it is blocked.

Diamond Model (https://www.threatintel.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/diamond-model.pdf)
- The Diamond Model describes an attack as the interaction between four elements (adversary, victim, infrastructure, and capability).

## a) Apache log

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c8db70-f844-4a3a-ae97-cfa7bf9e0fa6)

- Server is running

- In the picture localhost (me) sends a GET HTTP request. Server responds with a 200 "OK" status code. There is also information that I am using Firefox and Linux

## b) Nmapped

``nmap -A -p 80 localhost``
- Port 80 is open and running Apache httpd 2.4.63 on Debian
- Server is working in Linux 2.6.X
- Network Distance: 0 hops , so the server is on this machine

## c) Scripts

I found neat information from O'Reilly (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/nmap-network-exploration/9781786467454/916fdbc5-6ae2-4f8b-a5a2-c2515309daad.xhtml)
- -A, aggressive mode enables following flags:
- -o, OS detection ``Linux 2.6.X``
- -sV, service version detection ``Apache httpd 2.4.63 ((Debian))``
- -sC, runs default NSE scripts:
``
|_http-title: Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.63 (Debian)
``
- traceroute, maps hops ``Network Distance: 0 hops``
