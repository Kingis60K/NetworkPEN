## x) Read and Summarize

Pyramid of Pain (https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)
- The higher a technique is on the pyramid, the harder it is for the attack to continue once it is blocked.

Diamond Model (https://www.threatintel.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/diamond-model.pdf)
- The Diamond Model describes an attack as the interaction between four elements (adversary, victim, infrastructure, and capability).

## a) Apache log

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c8db70-f844-4a3a-ae97-cfa7bf9e0fa6)

- Server is running

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d215f5-5433-45e0-943d-2b8813418e8e)

- In the picture localhost (me) sends a GET HTTP request. Server responds with a 200 "OK" status code. There is also information that I am using Firefox and Linux

## b) Nmapped

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9cfaef6-b742-4d8b-8f50-b574a4571bf0)

``nmap -A -p 80 localhost``
- Port 80 is open and running Apache httpd 2.4.63 on Debian
- Server is working in Linux 2.6.X
- Network Distance: 0 hops , so the server is on this machine

## c) Scripts

I found neat information from O'Reilly (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/nmap-network-exploration/9781786467454/916fdbc5-6ae2-4f8b-a5a2-c2515309daad.xhtml)
- -A, aggressive mode enables following flags:
- -o, OS detection ``Linux 2.6.X``
- -sV, service version detection ``Apache httpd 2.4.63 ((Debian))``
- -sC, runs default NSE scripts:
``
|_http-title: Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.63 (Debian)
``
- traceroute, maps hops ``Network Distance: 0 hops``

## d) Traces in logs

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ecf5af-2752-4aa4-bf50-b5d03ab45407)

- We left quite a few traces when scanning in aggressive mode
- All the scans have been made on the same time 05:26:57

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b2e0da-bbf6-4aea-be6d-1d430fcd7e20)

- We could find all instances of Nmap like this ``cat /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep nmap``

## e) Wireshark

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fce6485-2cca-431a-8528-7ada15bed9e0)

- After some analyzing it seems that the packets are being sent from different ports
- In conclusion there are GET, OPTIONS, POST and PROPFIND requests sent by nmap

## f) Net grep

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7608e60-f07f-4ffe-9cd3-78e16efcbb07)

- Here is some captured traffic using command ``sudo ngrep -i "nmap" port 80``

## g) Agent

- I found an article about the subject from InfoSec(https://infosecwriteups.com/evading-detection-while-using-nmap-69633df091f3)
- So with a bit of modifying it became this command ``nmap -A -p 80 --script-args http.useragent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3" 127.0.0.1``

## h) Re-scan with new user-agent

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eda3336e-59f6-4a15-b7fc-a7a3b445d4d8)

- So now we only get one log regarding ``GET /nmaplowercheck1744194425`` with our modified user-agent

## i) LoWeR ChEcK

- In the assignment there is written that lowercheck can be found in ``/usr/share/nmap`` so lets search there and within all the subfolders: ``grep -r 'nmaplower' /usr/share/nmap``

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16baaf42-17d2-4dc2-9c01-ef8f31b2c975)

- The line of code we are looking for seems to be in ``/usr/share/nmap/nselib/http.lua``

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab64f9c7-79c1-4d52-94ff-fb8993cfa9a4)

- By using nano to inspect the file we find '/nmaplowercheck'

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e439f49-f2af-4d69-90e4-eeac9f1c1625)

- By putting two hyphens before the line it makes it a comment so when the rest of the code runs, it doesn't

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67dae686-28d5-4e2f-b492-cc5f3f512c5c)

- Finally running the modified code inspecting the network traffic yields nothing
