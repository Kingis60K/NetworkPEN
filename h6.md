- Using command ``sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`` we enter monitoring mode
- After that we use ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scan --manufacturer --wps --band abg`` we capture trafic in wlan0 which we save as a log

- Same setup as the last task but now we only want to see channel 11 so we: ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scanc11 --manufacturer --wps -c11``
- We take the mac address from the lower part of the report under STATION

- We first created a custom wordlist by having a "wifi-" prefix on every line: ``cat ~/rockyou-top100000.txt | awk '{print "wifi-" $1}' > ~/wifi-rockyou.txt ``
- We listened to channel 11 with: ``iwconfig wlan0mon channel 11``
- And then we used the command 'mdk4' to test wireless networks to bombard the AP with our wordlist ``mdk4 wlan0mon p -t F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26 -f ~/wifi-rockyou.txt``
- 04 done

- We first created a configuration file that included the discovered wifi ssid

- Then we connected to the network

- We requested an IP address from the DHCP server, we were given 192.168.16.1

- We surfed to the site

- And with the given credentials admin:admin we found the flag

## b) What did you learn
- I learned to turn my networkcard to monitor mode
- I learned to listen and capture internet trafic
- I learned to look for mac addresses and use channel filtered search

I will do more tasks later and learn new stuff. However so far I liked this way of learning. The tasks were small and easy to tackle but very informative on the subject.
The hints were really short though so I had to make use of the walkthrough instructions. They were well made.

## c) Did your feelings change towards WLAN security afterwards?
Yes. It seems that network trafic can be very easily monitored and logged. There is a good reason why you don't want to use public wlan but using private networks won't necessarily save you.
Consider nothing private and beware people from stealing your information.
