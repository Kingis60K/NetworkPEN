- Using command ``sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`` we enter monitoring mode
- After that we use ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scan --manufacturer --wps --band abg`` we capture trafic in wlan0 which we save as a log

- Same setup as the last task but now we only want to see channel 11 so we: ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scanc11 --manufacturer --wps -c11``
- We take the mac address from the lower part of the report under STATION

## b) What did you learn
- I learned to turn my networkcard to monitor mode
- I learned to listen and capture internet trafic
- I learned to look for mac addresses and use channel filtered search

I will do more tasks later and learn new stuff. However so far I liked this way of learning. The tasks were small and easy to tackle but very informative on the subject.
The hints were really short though so I had to make use of the walkthrough instructions. They were well made.

## c) Did your feelings change towards WLAN security afterwards?
Yes. It seems that network trafic can be very easily monitored and logged. There is a good reason why you don't want to use public wlan but using private networks won't necessarily save you.
Consider nothing private and beware people from stealing your information.
