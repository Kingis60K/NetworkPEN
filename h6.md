### 01

- Using command ``sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`` we enter monitoring mode
- After that we use ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scan --manufacturer --wps --band abg`` we capture trafic in wlan0 which we save as a log

### 02

- Same setup as the last task but now we only want to see channel 11 so we: ``sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scanc11 --manufacturer --wps -c11``
- We take the mac address from the lower part of the report under STATION

### 03

- The probe information is here

### 04

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daa4b7d1-58e7-48b9-9eb7-5e02ae959d3c)

- We first created a custom wordlist by having a "wifi-" prefix on every line: ``cat ~/rockyou-top100000.txt | awk '{print "wifi-" $1}' > ~/wifi-rockyou.txt ``
- We listened to channel 11 with: ``iwconfig wlan0mon channel 11``
- And then we used the command 'mdk4' to test wireless networks to bombard the AP with our wordlist ``mdk4 wlan0mon p -t F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26 -f ~/wifi-rockyou.txt``

### 05

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c67082a-221b-43f9-9937-db6731ffdf9b)

- We first created a configuration file that included the discovered wifi ssid

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/807c04b9-9d6b-4a0c-96d4-c759b9bd3059)

- Then we connected to the network

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e2d2291-8578-4a7d-8ca2-82a97cd5e2a2)

- We requested an IP address from the DHCP server, we were given 192.168.16.1

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c40da9a3-49b8-43b0-919a-294269a957e8)

- We surfed to the site
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d0e9748-7359-45e4-a902-fcf04baeb6e5)

- And with the given credentials admin:admin we found the flag

### 06

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e613e3-a970-4688-9bb1-7147e5795560)

- We took the same steps as before to get to this login site

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/455a503c-b472-478e-9545-45db44047c52)

- To bypass the first login we have to impersonate another active computer in the network
- By using ``sudo airodump-ng --bssid f0:9f:c2:71:22:10 --channel 6 --write clientscan wlan2mon`` we check the target network for trafic

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f75dcc4-1dc5-446a-9fa8-79e12f0142ba)

- Then we change our mac address: ``macchanger -m b0:72:bf:44:b0:49 wlan2``
- !!REMEMBER!! to first put the wlan down and then back up after the mac change

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd421c97-772d-4227-9d45-461c624c1809)

- Now we passed the first stage but we dont have credentials for this login

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46960eeb-d5b3-4e63-b1b3-f56469581548)

- So we recorded some traffic since the site was not HTTPS encrypted: ``sudo airodump-ng wlan2mon -w scanc6-01``
- And there we found credentials in plaintext

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22c03c5f-96ee-4106-8156-9b6142e89df0)

- We used those credentials to gain access to the site and find the flag

## b) What did you learn
- I learned to turn my networkcard to monitor mode
- I learned to listen and capture internet trafic
- I learned to look for mac addresses and use channel filtered search

I will do more tasks later and learn new stuff. However so far I liked this way of learning. The tasks were small and easy to tackle but very informative on the subject.
The hints were really short though so I had to make use of the walkthrough instructions. They were well made.

### EDIT 13.5.2025
Did some more tasks, they were insightful. Started to get more complex when I hit OPN missions. Cool stuff...

## c) Did your feelings change towards WLAN security afterwards?
Yes. It seems that network trafic can be very easily monitored and logged. There is a good reason why you don't want to use public wlan but using private networks won't necessarily save you.
Consider nothing private and beware people from stealing your information.
