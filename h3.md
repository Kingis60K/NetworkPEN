# h3 On the Waves
## x) Read and Summarize

SDR Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbqMqb6FVMY&t=199s&ab_channel=hubmartin)
  - In the video Martin shows us the basics of URH (Universal Radio Hacker) and makes his small radio emit a signal that works like the proper remote.

Decode weather station data (https://www.onetransistor.eu/2022/01/decode-433mhz-ask-signal.html)
  - Cornelius first tells us about his setup
  - He uses rtl_443 to decode so unknown devices can be found
  - Then there are instructions about the use of URH

## a) WebSDR

- In the screenshot I am listening to a radio located in Tambov, Russia
- Frequency: 3024 kHz
- Bandwidth: 15 khz
- Modulation: AM

## b) Install rtl_433 (https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433)

- Installation great success

## c) Analysis of a File

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4203e01-7c5e-4778-b2de-22d7b706392c)

- All of the devices seem to have the same ID: 8785315
- They are labeled 'security' or 'switch'
- All the devices are in State: OFF

## d) Too compex 16?

So I wasn't smart enough to solve this so here is a way AI would have done it

- So I am not sure what we were looking for. I had issues finding anything at first but looking at the analysis on the website triq.org confirmed that the file could be read.
- I had to widen my search with flag -A so I could see pulses in the file.
- The signal is clearly consistent with a short gap always in the beginning.

- Ok so I got stuck and decided to seek help from a friend
- It was as easy as to just change the filename from complex16s -> cs8


## e) Install URH (Ultimate Radio Hacker)(https://github.com/jopohl/urh?tab=readme-ov-file#Installation)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2801b24a-9f82-4a73-8bfe-4d76151e3bfa)

- Installed

### 1) Analysis

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19eb6561-23df-4550-a5d2-1ed0493a2f15)

- The whole file contains 3 sets of pulses lasting a total of 5.49 seconds

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0c64642-22e0-4c16-8386-d9884de119bc)

- In the info there are some useful insights like file size and file creation date

### 2) Demodule

- Pressing "Autodetect parameters" chose modulation as 'ASK'

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e48a57d5-1b53-4e40-abf8-3dea8998ea7a)

- One raw byte seems to be 520 microseconds long
- "520 microseconds is approximately the time it takes for light to travel about 156 meters in a vacuum." -ChatGPT
